# Merkle Trees in Go: Simple and Cartesian Implementations

This project demonstrates the implementation of two types of Merkle Trees using Golang:

1. **Simple Merkle Tree (SMT)**: A traditional Merkle Tree designed for cryptographic proofs of inclusion or exclusion, built on `github.com/iden3/go-merkletree-sql/v2`.
2. **Cartesian Merkle Tree (CMT)**: An advanced Merkle Tree combining features of **Binary Search Trees**, **Heaps**, and **Merkle Trees** (Treap-based). This is now **custom-implemented** without relying on `go-merkletree-sql` for the CMT logic, ensuring a fully deterministic, treap-like structure.

## Overview

Merkle Trees are cryptographic data structures widely used in blockchain systems, ZK rollups, and other applications requiring efficient and secure data verification. This project implements both SMT and CMT to explore their differences, benefits, and trade-offs.

- The **SMT** uses a standard binary Merkle approach via the `go-merkletree-sql` library.  
- The **CMT** is a **custom Treap-based** data structure that uses `priority = hash(key)` to maintain balance, storing data at **every node** rather than just the leaves.

---

## Features

### Simple Merkle Tree (SMT)
- Implements a traditional binary Merkle Tree structure using `go-merkletree-sql`.
- Stores data in leaf nodes only (library default).
- Efficient proof generation with `O(log(n))`.
- Ideal for simple membership proofs where you need a robust library-based approach.

### Cartesian Merkle Tree (CMT)
- **Treap-based** data structure combining:
  - **Binary Search Tree** ordering by `key`.
  - **Heap** property by `priority = sha256(key)`.
  - **Merkle Hash** (3-argument hash of `nodeKey`, `leftChildHash`, `rightChildHash`).
- Stores data in **every node**, requiring `n` total storage (instead of ~`2n` in a leaf-only design).
- Supports **insertion**, **removal**, and **proof generation/verification** with deterministic shape.
- Great for on-chain use cases or advanced ZK applications due to smaller on-chain footprint.

## Code Details

### **Simple Merkle Tree (SMT)**
- Uses the `go-merkletree-sql` library to handle storage and proof generation.
- Leaf-based data storage.
- Great for quick integration when you need a stable library approach.

### **Cartesian Merkle Tree (CMT)**
- Implements a **Treap**: BST by `key`, heap by `priority = sha256(key)`.
- Each node maintains a **3-argument Merkle hash**: `hash(nodeKey, leftChildHash, rightChildHash)`.
- Supports **insertion**, **removal**, and **inclusion-proof generation** in purely custom Go code.
- A better fit if you need a **deterministic** data structure or want to mirror an **on-chain** Treap-based approach.

## Testing the Application

1. **Add a new leaf/node**  
   ```bash
   # Simple Merkle Tree:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/simple/add

   # Cartesian Merkle Tree (Treap):
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cmt/add
   ```

2. **Generate inclusion proof**  
   ```bash
   # Simple Merkle Tree:
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/simple/proof

   # Cartesian Merkle Tree:
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/cmt/proof
   ```

3. **Remove a node (CMT only)**  
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cmt/remove
   ```
   Observe the updated root hash after successful removal.

4. Verify the generated proof in the **responses** (the server also does a local verification if you want to confirm correctness).

## Conclusion

This project highlights the key differences and use cases for **Simple** and **Treap-based Cartesian** Merkle Trees:

- **SMT** (Simple) is **straightforward** and ideal for basic applications or quick library usage.  
- **CMT** (Cartesian) offers **advanced** features: deterministic structure, optimized on-chain usage, and flexible proof logicâ€”perfect for zero-knowledge or more complex cryptographic needs.
